@brief This script integrates block detection and pose estimation using ROS, OpenCV, Open3D, and other libraries.

@mainpage Block Detection and Pose Estimation

@section Overview
This script integrates ROS (Robot Operating System) with computer vision techniques for block detection using the ZED camera.
It performs:
- Image processing to find regions of interest (ROIs) using OpenCV.
- Block detection using a custom Block Detection module (`Block_detection.py`).
- Point cloud processing and pose estimation using Open3D.

@section Details
The script subscribes to ROS topics for images (`/ur5/zed_node/left_raw/image_raw_color`) and point clouds
(`/ur5/zed_node/point_cloud/cloud_registered`). Upon receiving an image, it:
- Finds ROIs and detects blocks within the ROIs using `Block_detection.py`.
- Generates a point cloud from detected blocks and estimates their poses relative to a fixed coordinate system.

The script also uses Open3D for point cloud processing, including downsampling, feature extraction, and registration
algorithms (RANSAC and ICP) to refine pose estimation.

@subsection Dependencies
- ROS (Kinetic or newer)
- OpenCV
- Open3D
- NumPy
- SciPy
- CV Bridge (ROS)
- Sensor_msgs (ROS)

@subsection Directories
- `images/`: Contains images used for ROI detection and visualization.

@subsection Parameters
- `R_cloud_to_world`: Transformation matrix from cloud to world coordinates.
- `x_camera`: Camera position offset.
- `base_offset`: Base offset of the block.
- `block_offset`: Offset specific to each block.
- `voxel_size`: Size parameter for downsampling point clouds.

@subsection Flags
- `debug`: Flag to enable debug visualizations.

@subsection Classes
- `Point`: Stores point coordinates and pixel locations.
- `block`: ROS message type for block information.

@subsection Functions
- `get_img(img)`: Callback to process incoming images, detect ROIs, and detect blocks.
- `find_pose(point_cloud)`: Callback to process point clouds, estimate block poses, and publish results.
- Various utility functions for point cloud operations, mesh loading, transformation, and visualization.

@subsection Main
The script initializes ROS nodes and subscribers (`img_sub`, `point_cloud_sub`) and starts the main loop to process incoming messages.

@subsection Outputs
- Publishes block poses (`vision/position`) as ROS messages.
- Outputs debug visualizations and intermediate images to `images/` directory.

@subsection Authors
- Developed by [Author Name] at [Organization Name].

@subsection License
- This script is released under [License Type].\end{DoxyVerb}
